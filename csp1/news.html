	<h2>Bagong Buhay sa Bagong Silangan (A new life in Bagong Silangan)</h2>

	<p>On 18 May 2017, Base Bahay, together with Vincentian Missionaries Social Development Foundation Inc. (VMSDFI), turned over fifty homes to their beneficiaries in Vicente Village, Bagong Silangan through the project dubbed as “Bagong Silangan Kawayan Housing Initiative”. The project envisions the access to decent and safe shelter as an entry point towards building resilient, self-sustaining and caring community.</p>

	<p>In his message, Fr. Gerard Borja, the executive director of VMSDFI, said that the houses will be turned over to the families living in the danger zone of Payatas; specifically, those with a child or children who have special needs, and those with elderly family members. Furthermore, four of the houses will be allocated for productive older persons where they will stay and take care of each other and be integrated into the community. He then thanked the partners and private donors that made the project possible. VMSDFI is a faith-based organization that responds to the needs of vulnerable persons and communities to uplift their human dignity and potentials to become empowered members of society.</p>

	<p>The main component of the project is the construction of 50 houses built through a system called Cement-Bamboo Frame technology. Base General Manager Maricen Jalandoni, in her message, emphasized the advantages of Cement-Bamboo Houses over conventional social houses which include resistance against earthquake and tropical typhoons, cooler interior, and generous living spaces. Furthermore it helps the environment through the use of less conventional materials and more renewable ones like bamboo. It also provides economic impact to farmers and workers along the value chain.</p>

	<p>Councilor Marivic Co, who also chairs the City Housing Committee, said that she will recommend the inclusion of the technology in the City Building Code that she’s authoring so that more of Quezon City’s citizens will have access to decent homes. QC prides itself on its commitment to protect the environment, and implementing Green Building Programs.</p>

	<p>The event opened with a Mass Celebration presided by Bishop Antonio Tobias, DD, and attended by the Base Bahay and VMSDFI Team, Vincentian Community, Local Government of Quezon City through Vice Mayor Joy Belmonte and Councilor Marivic Co, private donors and the beneficiaries.</p>
